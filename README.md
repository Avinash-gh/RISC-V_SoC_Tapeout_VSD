# 🚀 My RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey

This repository documents my complete journey in the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.  
I’ll be sharing weekly progress, tools installed, experiments, and learnings from **RTL to Tapeout** using open-source EDA tools.

## 📖 About the Program
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** is a unique initiative that teaches students how to design and tape out a RISC-V based SoC using open-source tools.  
Out of 3500+ participants, only the top 50 students get a selected for the 2nd level and further for 3rd level, there will be top 20 students.
This program will help us to learn and motivate us to grow our knowledge and interest in VLSI domain.

## 🏛️ Key Organizations

### 🔹 VSD (VLSI System Design)
VSD is an open-source VLSI education platform led by Kunal Ghosh, focused on building accessible and industry-grade VLSI learning ecosystems.

### 🔹 Efabless
Efabless is a community-driven platform that enables **open-source chip design** and fabrication (tapeout) using the Google/SkyWater 130nm PDK.  
They power the **Open MPW Shuttle Program**, where open-source designs get manufactured for free.

### 🔹 RISC-V
RISC-V is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** that is free to use, unlike proprietary ISAs (ARM, x86).  
It is revolutionizing the semiconductor industry by enabling **collaborative innovation**.
